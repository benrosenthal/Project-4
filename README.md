BackLog is a social media-powered, self-report platform designed to enable and empower NYC’s hundreds of thousands of Section 8 residents to publish and file complaints regarding living standard problems, such as building maintenance neglect. 

While efforts by Mayor DeBlasio have had a moderately rehabilitative impact on Public Housing’s ever-weakening infrastructure, BackLog provides users the ability to voice and evidence their quality of life grievances on a public platform without the bureaucratic constraints of municipal agencies, such as 311, NYCHA, or the DOB.

To be clear, BackLog does not endeavor to replace the assistance provided, however flawed that assistance may prove, by NYC’s municipal agencies. BackLog is an outlet  through which residents can record, share, and collaborate to call much-needed attention to the existence and impact of NYCHA’s failures to address and solve sub-standard living conditions.
